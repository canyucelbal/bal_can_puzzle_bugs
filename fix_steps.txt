Fixing Steps 

1. Dropzone 

	- Check if it is full or empty
		a. Empty -> We have to append the dragged image
		b. Full -> We have to append the first child to puzzleParent


2. Reset
 
	a. Using the for loop 
		We have to roam the entire dropzones
	b. If statement inside "for loop" 
		We want dropzones to be full. (Should check if the dropzones are empty)
	c. If its full 
		We have to append the child to puzzleParent
